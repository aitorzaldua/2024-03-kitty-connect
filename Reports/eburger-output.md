# eBurger Static Analysis Report

This report was generated by the [eburger](https://github.com/forefy/eburger) static analyzer on 28.03.2024 at 15:51.

The results are not intended to substitute for comprehensive audits or professional assessments, and should be used only as a tool to help identify possible security vulnerabilities or insights and not for any other purpose.

## Insights Summary

| Issue | Severity | Occurrences |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| [[Low] Use of encodedPacked with Dynamic Data Types](#low-use-of-encodedpacked-with-dynamic-data-types) | Low | 1 |
| [[Low] Unspecific Solidity Pragma Detector](#low-unspecific-solidity-pragma-detector) | Low | 6 |
| [[Low] Missing Zero Address Check](#low-missing-zero-address-check) | Low | 6 |


### [Low] Use of encodedPacked with Dynamic Data Types
It's recommended to avoid `abi.encodePacked()` for dynamic data types before hashing operations, like with `keccak256()`.

#### Vulnerable Locations
- src/KittyConnect.sol:200:13-29
	```
	abi.encodePacked
	```

#### Action Items
- Unless encodePacked is necessary, switch from `abi.encodePacked()` to `abi.encode()` in scenarios involving dynamic types ahead of hash function usage.
- Consider `bytes.concat()` for concatenating strings or bytes, as a preferable method over `abi.encodePacked()`.

### [Low] Unspecific Solidity Pragma Detector
Detects the usage of unspecific compiler pragmas that allow for a broader range of compiler versions than necessary, which can lead to unintended behavior or compiler warnings/errors with newer versions.

#### Vulnerable Locations
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/applications/CCIPReceiver.sol:2:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/interfaces/IAny2EVMMessageReceiver.sol:2:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/interfaces/IRouterClient.sol:2:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/libraries/Client.sol:2:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/vendor/openzeppelin-solidity/v4.8.0/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol:4:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/vendor/openzeppelin-solidity/v4.8.0/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol:4:1-24
	```
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

#### Action Items
- Specify a more precise range of compiler versions in the pragma statement to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

### [Low] Missing Zero Address Check
In Solidity, contracts often interact with external addresses. Failing to check for a possible 0 address input (especially in constructors, setters, and initializer functions) before such interactions can lead to unexpected dangerous behavior. A zero address check ensures that addresses are explicitly provided and not left uninitialized or set to a default, invalid state.

#### Vulnerable Locations
- lib/ccip/contracts/src/v0.8/ccip/applications/CCIPReceiver.sol:14:15-29
	```
	address router
	```
- src/KittyBridge.sol:25:17-32
	```
	address _router
	```
- src/KittyBridge.sol:25:34-47
	```
	address _link
	```
- src/KittyBridge.sol:25:49-74
	```
	address kittyConnectOwner
	```
- src/KittyConnect.sol:61:45-59
	```
	address router
	```
- src/KittyConnect.sol:61:61-73
	```
	address link
	```

#### Action Items
- Use require statements to validate addresses before any operation involving external addresses is performed, especially on constructors, setters or initializer functions.
